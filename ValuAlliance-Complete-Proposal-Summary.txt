SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM — WHY THIS PROJECT EXISTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ValuAlliance Asset Management Limited is a licensed asset management firm
operating under Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They provide:
  • Portfolio management
  • Investment advisory
  • Fund management services

…to both institutional and retail clients in Nigeria's capital market ecosystem.

CURRENT STATE (The Pain):
ValuAlliance currently relies on a combination of:
  - Manual processes
  - Spreadsheets
  - Disconnected, siloed tools

This creates serious business problems:
  1. Operational Risk    — manual errors in trade entry, pricing, reconciliation
  2. Data Integrity      — no single source of truth for positions and valuations
  3. Compliance Exposure — difficulty producing timely, accurate SEC filings
  4. Governance Gaps     — no enforced maker-checker, no immutable audit trail
  5. Scalability Limits  — cannot grow AUM or product range without re-engineering

WHAT IS NEEDED:
A single, integrated platform serving as the operational backbone for:
  → Investment management
  → Financial reporting
  → Regulatory compliance
  → Client analytics


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSAL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Qucoon Limited proposes to design, build, implement, and support a purpose-built,
cloud-native Asset Management Application for ValuAlliance.

WHY QUCOON:
  • Built Global Custody Solution for FSDH Merchant Bank (trade capture, settlement,
    reconciliation, CSCS/FMDQ integration — directly equivalent to this project)
  • Built Trade Register Automation for Stanbic IBTC
  • Understand both the operational workflows AND the regulatory landscape
    ValuAlliance operates within
  • Technology choices (Java, React, MsSQL on AWS) prioritise performance,
    security, and zero licensing costs on the database layer

DELIVERY: 16 weeks, phased. Working software demonstrated every 2 weeks.

4C. DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE (AWS Cloud)
  • Two isolated AWS accounts: Development and Production
  • VPC with private subnets for all backend services
  • Public access ONLY through API Gateway
  • Network Firewall → API Gateway → ALB → ECS → RDS
  • Secrets: AWS Secrets Manager (credentials, API keys) + KMS (encryption keys)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 8: DATA MIGRATION STRATEGY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCOPE: Client master data, security master, portfolio and position data,
       transaction history (up to 5 years), financial records (current state),
       documents (to S3).

FOUR STAGES:
  Stage 1 — Assessment (Weeks 1–2):
    • Inventory existing data sources
    • Assess data quality
    • Define migration scope (which data, how far back)
    • Identify cleansing needs
    Deliverable: Data inventory and scope agreement

  Stage 2 — Design (Weeks 3–5):
    • Define source-to-target mapping
    • Define transformation rules and validation checks
    • Develop migration scripts and test data sets
    Deliverable: Data mapping specification and migration scripts

  Stage 3 — Trial Execution (Weeks 10–12):
    • Trial migration in staging environment
    • Validate against source
    • Resolve discrepancies
    Deliverable: Trial migration report

  Stage 4 — Production Migration & Validation (Weeks 14–16):
    • Production migration during planned cutover window
    • Minimum 2-week parallel run
    • Reconcile record counts, balances, and positions
    • User verification and formal sign-off
    Deliverable: Production migration report + Reconciliation sign-off

CONTROLS:
  • Record/balance reconciliation after every migration run
  • Minimum 2-week parallel run (old and new systems running simultaneously)
  • Full rollback procedure tested during trial migration
  • Migration not considered complete until ValuAlliance business sign-off


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 9: QUALITY ASSURANCE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Quality is built into every sprint — not added at the end:
  1. Code reviews on every pull request with automated linting
  2. Unit tests in CI pipeline — 80% code coverage target
  3. Integration tests on every staging deployment
  4. Dedicated system, performance & security testing phase (Weeks 10–11)
  5. UAT by ValuAlliance business users (Weeks 12–13) using real workflow scenarios
